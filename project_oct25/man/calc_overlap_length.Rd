\title{Helper Function: Calculate Interval Overlap Length}
\usage{
calc_overlap_length(start1, end1, start2, end2)
}
\arguments{
\item{start1}{Start position of the first interval.}

\item{end1}{End position of the first interval.}

\item{start2}{Start position of the second interval.}

\item{end2}{End position of the second interval.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector representing the overlap length (or 0 if no overlap).
}
\description{
Calculates the non-negative length of the overlap between two intervals.
This function is essential for Task 10 and 11 when converting genomic coordinates
(start1, end1) and (start2, end2) into a physical length.
