\title{Task 11.3: Find Genes Hit by HIGH Variants Across All Samples}
\usage{
task11_find_genes_in_all_samples(dt_high_impact_summary, dt_all_variants)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt_high_impact_summary}{A data.table summarized by 'gene' and 'sample_id'
(from T11.1/11.2).}

\item{dt_all_variants}{The original dt_variants table, used only to determine
the total number of unique samples (total universe).}
}
\value{
A data.table containing only the 'gene' IDs that were hit in all samples.
}
\description{
Identifies which genes in the summary table (from T11.2) have at least
one HIGH impact variant in every single sample present in the input.
}
