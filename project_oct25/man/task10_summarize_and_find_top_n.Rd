\title{Task 10.2: Summarize Overlap Length and Find Top 20 Genes}
\usage{
task10_summarize_and_find_top_n(dt_overlapped_stats)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt_overlapped_stats}{A data.table containing 'gene' and 'overlap_len' (from T10.1).}
}
\value{
A data.table with 'gene' and 'total_overlap_bp' for the top 20 genes.
}
\description{
Aggregates the results from the spatial join to calculate the total
base-pair overlap length per gene and returns the top 20 genes with the longest
total overlap.
}
