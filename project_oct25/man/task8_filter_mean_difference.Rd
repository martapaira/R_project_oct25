\title{Task 8.2: Filter Genes based on Mean Difference (Treated > Control)}
\usage{
task8_filter_mean_difference(dt_stats_long)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt_stats_long}{A data.table in long format (from T8.1) containing metrics for
each (gene, condition) pair.}
}
\value{
A data.table in wide format containing only the filtered genes.
}
\description{
Takes the robust statistics table (from T8.1), pivots it to a wide
format using \code{dcast}, and filters for genes where the mean count in the 'treated'
condition is strictly greater than the mean count in the 'control' condition.
}
