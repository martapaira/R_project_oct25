\title{Task 10.1: Map ATAC Peaks to Genes via Spatial Join (foverlaps)}
\usage{
task10_calculate_overlap_stats(dt_peaks, dt_genes)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt_peaks}{A data.table containing ATAC peaks with 'chr', 'start', 'end'.}

\item{dt_genes}{A data.table containing gene annotations with 'chr', 'start', 'end', and 'gene' ID.}
}
\value{
A data.table containing all overlapping pairs and the calculated overlap length ('overlap_len').
}
\description{
Performs an optimized genomic interval join using \code{data.table::foverlaps}
to map ATAC peaks to overlapping gene regions. It counts the number of overlapping
peaks per gene and calculates the overlap length per pair.
